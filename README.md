# WordPress + Gatsby with Advanced Custom Fields and WPGraphQL

This project was built as [part of a livestream](https://youtu.be/DH7I1xRrbxs?list=PLz8Iz-Fnk_eTpvd49Sa77NiF8Uqq5Iykx) on [Learn With Jason](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz8Iz-Fnk_eTpvd49Sa77NiF8Uqq5Iykx).

It uses WordPress as a data source via [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) to build a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) site.
